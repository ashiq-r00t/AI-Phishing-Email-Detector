My Task is to build a Security Project with the Help of AI: New joiners in the Security Industry take advantage of this:)

Project Title: AI-Based Phishing Email Detector

So on Day 1:  

Task 1: I created a Git Hub Account

Task 2: Installing Python on my Mac and checking it with the python3 —version command 

Task 3: Installing Git on Mac with the help of the command below: 
Command: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)” 

Once this gets downloaded, we need to install Git on Mac 
Command: brew install git

Once Git is installed, verify it using: git —version 


All this has been successfully implemented on day 1


Motive: Doing Something Great Every Day :)
